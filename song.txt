Not many days
Are left for us to find Something that satisfies.

Is there a way
To touch the other side,
A universe outside?
A different place
Where we don't have to hide Our spirit inside.
We don't have to...

Here comes the daylight.
I've been staying up all night. I'm just killing my time. 'Cause I'm looking for Something to free me.
Each day keeps repeating.

Stayin' on a joy ride, Doing everything you can To shield your eyes.
You're just killing your time. 'Cause you're looking for Something assuring
That everything's okay.

We don’t have to, we don’t have to. We don't have to...
